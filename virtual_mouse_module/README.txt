To install/remove the module simply run the setup.py script after
copying the folder that contains all these files (virtual_mouse_module)
in any place of your Linux computer.

To use the module run either gpiomaus.py, gpiomaus_test.py or key2mouse.py.

Depending on which script you run, you will be able to control

the mouse cursor with a console application that asks you in which direction
to move and how many pixels (gpiomaus_test.py). Or to control the cursor
with the GPIO pins of a Raspberry Pi (if you are running the module in such
device), or to control the cursor with your keyboard.
